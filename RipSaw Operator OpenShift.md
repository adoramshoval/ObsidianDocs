The **RipSaw operator** is an open-source benchmarking and performance testing framework for Kubernetes and OpenShift. It automates the deployment and management of benchmarking tools (e.g., FIO for storage testing, UPerf for network performance) in a Kubernetes/Openshift environment. RipSaw helps users run workloads and collect performance data from the environment to evaluate system performance.

### Key Features of RipSaw
- Automates the process of deploying and running various benchmarks.
- Provides an operator-based approach to manage performance tests.
- Easily customizable through custom resources (CRs) for specific workloads.
- Can integrate with multiple observability tools.

### Sending Data to Prometheus Using RipSaw

Yes, RipSaw can send performance data to **Prometheus**. Here's how it works and how you can configure it:

1. **Benchmark Workloads with Prometheus Metrics**:
   RipSaw integrates with benchmarking tools that expose metrics compatible with Prometheus. Many of the benchmarks used with RipSaw (like UPerf, FIO, or other tools) can be configured to export their metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape.

2. **Prometheus Integration**:
   - The **RipSaw operator** includes the ability to configure Prometheus endpoints. It will expose benchmarking metrics through Prometheus endpoints so that they can be scraped by an existing Prometheus instance in your cluster.
   - RipSaw provides Prometheus-compatible exporters that will expose the metrics generated by the tests.

3. **Steps to Configure Prometheus with RipSaw**:
   To send benchmarking data to Prometheus using RipSaw, follow these steps:

   - **Deploy Prometheus**: If Prometheus is not already deployed in your cluster, deploy it using the Prometheus Operator or any other method.
   - **Configure RipSaw**: Use a custom resource definition (CRD) from RipSaw to define the benchmark you want to run (e.g., `fio`, `uperf`). Ensure that the Prometheus scraping annotations are set in the CRD.

   Example annotations in the CRD:
   ```yaml
   metadata:
     annotations:
       prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
       prometheus.io/port: "8080" # Specify the port for metrics
   ```

   - **Expose Metrics**: Ensure that the benchmark tools you are using within RipSaw (e.g., `uperf`) expose their performance data via `/metrics` in a Prometheus-compatible format.
   
   - **Configure Prometheus to Scrape Metrics**: Update your Prometheus configuration to scrape the RipSaw benchmarks' metrics endpoints. This typically involves adding a scrape configuration to Prometheus that targets the pods or services where the RipSaw workloads are running.

4. **Visualizing Data**:
   Once the metrics are scraped by Prometheus, you can visualize the performance data using **Grafana**. You can create custom dashboards to monitor storage performance, network throughput, or other benchmark metrics.

#### **Pros and Cons of RipSaw**

Here are the **pros and cons of RipSaw** based on its functionality and features, especially considering that you don’t want to operate Elasticsearch clusters:

##### **Pros of RipSaw**

1. **Automates Benchmarking**:
   - RipSaw automates the setup, execution, and cleanup of performance benchmarking workloads in Kubernetes or OpenShift environments. This reduces manual work and complexity for running and managing tests like storage (FIO), network (UPerf), or database performance.

2. **Operator-Based Approach**:
   - As an operator, RipSaw is Kubernetes-native, meaning it works efficiently within the cluster's control plane. It leverages Kubernetes' reconciliation loops, making it easy to manage performance tests declaratively using Custom Resources (CRs).

3. **Integrates with Prometheus**:
   - RipSaw can easily export metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format, which is beneficial if you're already using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. This allows you to visualize benchmarking data without needing to introduce other data collection tools like Elasticsearch.
  
4. **Scalability**:
   - RipSaw can handle tests at scale. Since it operates within the Kubernetes ecosystem, it can run performance tests on different nodes or workloads concurrently, allowing you to assess the performance of large-scale deployments.

5. **Support for Multiple Benchmarks**:
   - RipSaw supports various performance benchmarks out of the box (e.g., `FIO`, `UPerf`, `sysbench`). It’s extensible, so you can also integrate custom benchmarking tools into the RipSaw framework if needed.

6. **Extensible and Flexible**:
   - You can extend RipSaw by adding new benchmarking workloads or customizing existing tests. It offers flexibility for creating and deploying custom workloads specific to your needs.

7. **Declarative Configuration**:
   - By defining benchmarking jobs in YAML, you can use GitOps workflows to manage and track changes to your performance tests, adding an additional layer of transparency and control.

##### **Cons of RipSaw**

1. **Limited by Available Benchmarks**:
   - Although RipSaw supports a variety of benchmarks, you may run into limitations if your specific benchmarking tool isn't natively supported. In such cases, you would need to develop custom benchmarking workloads and ensure that their metrics are Prometheus-compatible.

2. **No Elasticsearch Support Out-of-the-Box**:
   - If you rely on **ElasticSearch/Kibana** for logging or advanced search and indexing, RipSaw does not integrate well with these tools by default. However, since you're not interested in operating Elasticsearch clusters, this might actually be a **pro** for your scenario.

3. **Requires Prometheus for Best Integration**:
   - While Prometheus is commonly used in Kubernetes environments, RipSaw does not natively handle logging, so you will need to configure Prometheus for scraping metrics, which can be another layer of setup if you aren't already using it.

4. **Learning Curve**:
   - While operator-based automation reduces the operational overhead, there is a learning curve associated with using RipSaw, especially if you are unfamiliar with Kubernetes operators, custom resource definitions (CRDs), or performance testing in containerized environments.

5. **Resource-Intensive**:
   - Running extensive benchmarks can be resource-heavy, depending on the workload. This can increase resource consumption on the cluster during tests, potentially affecting other workloads.

6. **Limited Built-in Data Storage/Visualization**:
   - RipSaw is primarily focused on collecting benchmarking data and sending it to external systems like Prometheus or Elasticsearch for storage and visualization. If you don’t have Prometheus and Grafana set up, this requires additional setup and configuration.

### **FIO Bench Marking Example**

### Overview of the Setup

To run **FIO storage benchmarks** on all nodes in your OpenShift cluster using RipSaw and have Prometheus scrape the results, you'll need to:
1. Configure the RipSaw operator to deploy the FIO benchmark.
2. Ensure FIO generates Prometheus-compatible metrics.
3. Set up Prometheus to scrape the metrics.

### RipSaw YAML Configuration for FIO Benchmark

Here’s a step-by-step guide with the necessary YAML configurations:

#### 1. **Install RipSaw Operator**

First, install the RipSaw operator in your OpenShift cluster. If you haven't done this already, you can deploy it using the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/benchmark-operator.git
cd benchmark-operator
kubectl create -f deploy/
```

This will install the RipSaw operator into your cluster and create the necessary custom resource definitions (CRDs).

#### 2. **YAML for the FIO Benchmark on All Nodes**

Here's a basic YAML file to configure the **FIO benchmark** to run on all nodes in the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: ripsaw.cloudbulldozer.io/v1alpha1
kind: Benchmark
metadata:
  name: fio-benchmark
  namespace: my-namespace  # Replace with the desired namespace
spec:
  workload:
    name: fio
    args:
      serviceaccount: benchmark-operator
      clients: 3 # Adjust this based on how many nodes you want to run on
      jobs:
        - name: write-test
          rw: write
          size: 1G
          bs: 4k
          iodepth: 4
          runtime: 60
          ramp_time: 5
          numjobs: 1
      pin: true # This ensures jobs are spread across nodes
    env:
      prometheus_server: "http://prometheus-k8s.openshift-monitoring.svc:9090" # Adjust this if your Prometheus server is at a different endpoint
      prometheus_scrape: "true"
```

- **`clients`**: Defines how many FIO clients to run. Adjust this to match the number of nodes.
- **`pin`**: Ensures that the benchmark is distributed across all nodes.
- **Prometheus Annotations**: You can add the necessary annotations for Prometheus scraping below.

#### 3. **Prometheus Annotations in YAML**

To enable Prometheus to scrape FIO benchmark metrics, you need to annotate the FIO pods:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9091"  # Set to the port exposing FIO metrics
    prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
```

Ensure these annotations are added to the relevant pods or services so Prometheus knows to scrape from them.

### 4. **Prometheus Scraping Configuration**

Ensure that Prometheus is configured to scrape the FIO pods. This can be done by adding the following `scrape_config` in your Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'fio-benchmark'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
        action: keep
        regex: true
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
        action: replace
        target_label: __metrics_path__
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
        action: replace
        target_label: __address__
        regex: (.*)
        replacement: $1
```

This configuration tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from all pods annotated with `prometheus.io/scrape=true`.

### FIO Image and Prometheus Metrics

RipSaw uses a **prebuilt image for FIO** that includes configurations for running storage benchmarks and exposing the results as metrics. By default, RipSaw’s **FIO benchmark** will output metrics compatible with Prometheus.

The FIO image used by RipSaw typically is stored at:
```
quay.io/cloud-bulldozer/fio:latest
```

#### Key Points About the Image:
- This image includes **FIO** (Flexible I/O tester) and additional configurations to expose metrics via an HTTP server.
- The metrics are exposed at `/metrics` on port `9091`, which is why you need to ensure Prometheus is scraping from this endpoint.
- FIO jobs generate statistics such as throughput, IOPS, latency, and these are exposed in a Prometheus-compatible format.

#### Configuring FIO for Prometheus

To configure FIO to generate Prometheus metrics:
1. **Ensure that the container exposes metrics at `/metrics`**.
2. **Configure Prometheus Scraping**: This can be done by setting up Prometheus annotations in the YAML file (shown above).

### 5. **Visualization in Grafana**

After Prometheus starts scraping the metrics, you can use **Grafana** to visualize the data:
- Create a new Grafana dashboard.
- Use queries based on metrics like `fio_read_iops`, `fio_write_iops`, `fio_read_bw`, and `fio_write_bw` to monitor performance.

### Final YAML Example (Full Configuration):

Here’s the complete YAML configuration for running an FIO benchmark on all nodes and exposing metrics to Prometheus:

```yaml
apiVersion: ripsaw.cloudbulldozer.io/v1alpha1
kind: Benchmark
metadata:
  name: fio-benchmark
  namespace: my-namespace  # Replace with your namespace
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9091"
    prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
spec:
  workload:
    name: fio
    args:
      serviceaccount: benchmark-operator
      clients: 3 # Adjust to the number of nodes in your cluster
      jobs:
        - name: write-test
          rw: write
          size: 1G
          bs: 4k
          iodepth: 4
          runtime: 60
          ramp_time: 5
          numjobs: 1
      pin: true
    env:
      prometheus_server: "http://prometheus-k8s.openshift-monitoring.svc:9090"
      prometheus_scrape: "true"
```
